#How to run the program: 
1) Make sure matplotlib environment is active "Source activate <envname>"
2) to run: python main.py

Need to import all these .py files into driver for the functions to run due to cross dependencies

#TODO:

    Finish Middle School 
      Create driver program that integrates the functions into something that completes the tasks 
      Complete analysis of the programs 
      Complete report draft and send to other team
